## Introduction

PhishInspector is a website designed to help users assess the safety of any website they visit. With phishing attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated, PhishInspector uses a unique approach to evaluate the trustworthiness of websites by providing a safety percentage for each one. The website includes essential features such as signup, login, contact us, and about us pages. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, PhishInspector can detect common characteristics of phishing websites and provide users with valuable information on the safety of the websites they intend to visit. The main homepage displays the safety percentage of websites, offering users a quick insight into how secure their browsing experience is. With PhishInspector, users can stay one step ahead of potential cyber threats and keep their personal information safe.
